### Detector geometries relevant for the Muon Collider detector simulation

| Geometry name         | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `CLIC_o3_v14`         | Original CLIC detector geometry as of October 2019 |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod1`    | Modified CLIC geometry with inner radii of all forward detectors increased to accomodate the MAP nozzles for sqrt(s) = 1.5TeV Muon Collider. Vertex Endcaps have no propeller structure. |
| `FCCee_o1_v04`        | FCC geometry that has flat Vertex Endcap disk structure, replicated in `CLIC_o3_v14_mod1`
