### Detector geometries relevant for the Muon Collider detector simulation

| Geometry name         | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `CLIC_o3_v14`         | Original CLIC detector geometry as of October 2019 |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod1`    | Modified CLIC geometry with inner radii of all forward detectors increased to accomodate the MAP nozzles for sqrt(s) = 1.5TeV Muon Collider. Vertex Endcaps have no propeller structure. |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod2`    | Fixed ECAL Endcaps to fit tight around the nozzles |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod3`    | Vertex detector with shorter barrel and +1 layer/disk to be similar to the MAP design |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod4`    | Vertex Barrel segmented in 5 modules (L=26mm) along Z |
| `CLIC_o3_v14_mod5`    | Better Theta coverage in Vertex Endcap. MAP magnetic field |
| `FCCee_o1_v04`        | FCC geometry that has flat Vertex Endcap disk structure, replicated in `CLIC_o3_v14_mod1`
